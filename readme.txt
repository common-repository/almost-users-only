If logged in, the visitor can view all the pages/posts on the blog. If not logged in, the visitor can only view a specific public page.

== Description ==

Almost Users Only is a plugin that limits public access to your blog. Visitors that are not logged in can only view a specific public page. If they are trying to reach other pages they will automatically be redirected to the public page.

If a visitor is logged in, he can view all the pages/posts on the blog (just like if it were a normal Wordpress installation).

The public page can for example be used to display information about the site and a guide to how visitors can get an account.

<b>IMPORTANT:</b> Wordpress still publish RSS feeds, so posts can still be read that way. Pages should be save though.

== Installation ==

1. Upload /almost-users-only/ to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Active the plugin through the Plugins menu in Wordpress.
3. Go to the Settings menu, click the Users Only administration page and set the public page (the complete url).
